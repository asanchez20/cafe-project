                <p> Double A Cafe was founded by two life long friends by the names of Aden and Alvin, hence where the name "Double A" comes from in 2019.
                    Here we strive to give you a safe space to come and relax at our lounge area doing your work while you sip on our exquisite drinks. When in a rush, you can order online for pickup. New York is busy, but never too busy for some coffee ! </p>
